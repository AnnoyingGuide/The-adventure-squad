Welcome to the my little (and maybe the first?) pack of followers for TerraGuardians

There are 3 of them currently Nathan, Logan, and Hero

Get them on your side by using the bags you'll be given with a new character or just use cheat sheet

Leave a comment if there's another character you might want to see later. Give me a general rundown of the character and I might try and add them.

Do you just want these guys and no Guardians? First off You Monster! Secondly you can have just these guys with no guardians by disabling "Enable Mod Companions to spawn" in the TerraGuardians config.
