Welcome to the my little (and maybe the first?) pack of followers for TerraGuardians

There are 5 of them currently Nathan, Logan, Hero, Shiro, and Nago

Get them on your side by using the bags you'll be given with a new character or just use cheat sheet

Starter items for each are as followed

Nathan starts with a Wooden Sword and Finch Staff

Logan starts with a Tin Broadsword

Hero starts with a Wand of Sparking

Shiro starts with a Wooden Bow and some Arrows

Nago starts with a Copper ShortSword

Do you just want these guys and no Guardians? You can have just these guys with no guardians by disabling "Enable Mod Companions to spawn" in the TerraGuardians config.
